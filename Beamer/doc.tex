\justify
In this experiment two players are matched randomly and anonymously. Each of them can decide whether to cooperate or defect. Defection leads to better outcome for the defector and worse for the other player. If both players cooperate, they can get (a,a). All combinations of outcomes are displayed in the table below.\\

To induce the cooperation of player 2, player 1 can promise a reward to player 2 in case they manage both to cooperate. Then both players decide whether to cooperate or not. If they both decide to cooperate, player 1 can decide how much to send to player 2 (independently from the original promise).\\

\begin{center}
   \begin{tabular}{lcc}
     & \textbf{cooperate} &  \textbf{defect} \\
      \textbf{cooperate} &  (a,a) & (0,b) \\
      \textbf{defect} & (b,0) & (d,d) \\    
 \end{tabular}
